# Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list some data analytics and data science projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

- Koin Project (Python and Tableau)

Code: Febriyeni-Koin Projects-CIA.ipynb;

Description: The dataset contains 2511 records as of May 2021. There is a list of lenders with user_name,	loan_duration,	loan_grade,	lender_interest, total_purchase, order_status,	order_type,	order_date,	product, and	sub_product. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), Encoding variable, Scaling variable, Split Data Train and Test, Predictive modelling using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization, supervised learning model. Technology: Tableau, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: Predictive modeling with the k-nearest neighbors' algorithm as supervised learning. In this project, I need to identify which users have the potential to be Mass/White/Silver/Gold lenders so that the company can upsell these lenders based on their predicted class.

- Clustering and Credit Scoring Fintech Project
Code: final_project.ipynb
Presentation: my_project_slides.pdf
Description: Customer segmentation using the KMeans algorithm as part of clustering analysis and finding the feature importance by comparing different algorithms. The dataset contains 2511 records as of May 2021. There is a list of lenders with user_name,	loan_duration,	loan_grade,	lender_interest, total_purchase, order_status,	order_type,	order_date,	product, and	sub_product. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.
Skills: data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.
Results: According to the evaluation metrics, the Naive-Bayes classifier works best because it gives the highest recall. However, when plotting the ROC curve and calculating AUC for all models, it is seen that XGB gives the highest AUC. So, the three features that have the most significant percentage using XGBoost are duration, Saving Accounts, and Housing

- Commuter Indonesia
Code: notebook.ipynb
Presentation: slides.pdf
Description: My solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by Карьерный Цех. The solution took the 7th place in the competition (≈100 solutions were submitted by participants).
Skills: evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion rate, calculating bounce rate, log-scale transformations, Shapiro–Wilk test of distribution normality, A/B-tests (proportions z-test, Mann–Whitney rank test), plotting results, making conclusion and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.
Results: A/B test design analysis, conclusion on rolling the new landing page design to production, recommendations on how to improve.

- Immunization Indonesia
Code: ya_ad_int_solution.ipynb
Presentation: ya_ad_int_slides_upd.pdf
Description: My submission to Yandex Advertising Analytics internship program.
Skills: data cleaning, CTR, CPC, CPA and CR calculation, comparing metrics with competitors, visualizing results, drawing conclusions.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: the slide deck with online advertising campaign analysis and recommendations on how to improve based on the service category.

- Research
Tableau Public: dashboard
Dashboard canvas: dashboard_canvas.pdf
Description: Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated renting property occupation rate; analytical chart to choose the best property by occupation rate, review score and price per night; a ranked table of top listings by calculated potential annual revenue; average price, average occupation rate and a number of unique listings KPIs; filters by neighborhood, occupation rate and a number of reviews per the last twelve month.
Skills: interview with a customer, requirements capture, designing an analytical dashboard, product delivery.
Technology: Tableau.
Results: created an analytical dashboard to support daily activities of a company involved in apartments renting business.

# SQL
Description: SQL queries for tasks from codecademy, sql-ex.ru, stepik, sql module on Yandex Praktikum, etc.
Repository: Check the repository having 400+ SQL queries ---> go to repo..
Status: Some of the courses are still in progress.
